1-Wire protocol handling:

1 bit == 64 us
bit starts at timer value 64 - 80 (8 to 10 us into cycle of 32us)

Write 0:
- Wait for bit start (0 us)
- pull low
- Wait for bit start (32 us)
- busy wait 2us
- Wait for bit start (64 us)
- let go

Write 1:
- Wait for bit start (0 us)
- pull low
- wait 8us busy loop
- let go		(8us)
- Wait for bit start	(32 us)
- busy wait 2us
- Wait for bit start	(64 us)

Read:
- Wait for bit start
- pull low
- wait 8us busy
- let go
- Wait for bit start
- sample
- busy wait 2us
- Wait for bit start

Reset/Presence:
- sync to bits
- pull
- wait for 15 loops (480us)
- let go
- wait for 3 loops
- sample presence
- wait for 1 loop

Optimized byte transmit:

- wait for bit start
- let go (if held)
- busy wait 4us
- pull
if (bit == 1) {
	wait 8us (now at 22 out of 32)
	let go
}
- wait for bit start 
- busy wait 2us
goto start
